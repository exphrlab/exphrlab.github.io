        **Participants** are randomized into *Music + Exercise* or *Exercise* group.  
        Exercise routines are identical for both groups.

        🎵 **Music Group:** Receives personalized playlists based on their own music interests.  
        💪 **Exercise Group:** Performs the same exercise sessions without music.

        By providing enjoyable, beat-enhanced music, we aim to improve participants’ relationship to exercise and motivation.  
        We believe those in the music group will engage in **greater physical activity** compared to those who do not.

        As our study population consists of sedentary older adults, all exercises are **accessible and scalable** (using a band, chair, wall, etc.).
