                At ExPHR, we are dedicated to supporting healthy aging through
                evidence-based lifestyle change. Our mission is to help midlife
                and older adults — with and without chronic health conditions —
                adopt sustainable habits in exercise, nutrition, and sleep that
                protect long-term brain and body health.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our research investigates the neural and psychological mechanisms
                that drive behavior change and resilience, with a particular focus
                on how exercise can support brain function as we age. We also
                develop music-based interventions to support rehabilitation in
                individuals with neurologic impairments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, our goal is to create accessible, enjoyable, and lasting
                physical activity strategies that empower older adults to maintain
                independence, enhance quality of life, and promote optimal aging.
